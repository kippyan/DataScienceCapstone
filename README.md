This capstone project is going to be centered around helping teachers process student learning surveys with data science. It will involve configuring a Google Lens camera to scan printed and manually filled-out student learning surveys. In addition, we will need to develop an algorithm for combining the resultant data such that surveys with different formats can all be stored together. 

This project's name and description are going to change as the details of the project are solidified. In any case it will include a synthesis of what I've learned in my computer science, math, and data science classes.
